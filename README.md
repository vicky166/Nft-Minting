# Nft minting
# There are 3 NFT (Non Fungible Token) standard used in this project:

# ERC721
 # ERC721A
# ERC1155



# *  ERC721

## The ERC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of Token is unique and can have a different value than another Token from the same Smart Contract, maybe due to its age, rarity, or even something else like its visual.
## Token created on ERC721 standard -> 0x0d54c589f0e69b672eaab60c938b6bdab065af21
## First transfer Transaction -> 0xb63c3f66321c9d57ec890d92154310e0a85dff20a21826672dd47de6eb382009


## The goal of ERC721A is to provide a fully compliant implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.
